# Parallel-Processing-Call-Data
To run this code you must first integrate your IDE to import Hadoop libraries so that we can replicate a multi-node processing cluster. From there you have to manually configure the input/output files in the IDE so that the java code knows what data to read in and the destination to submit the output file. For an indepth review of how to code works please see the CodeExplanation file. In summary this code maps a phone number to all of its call durations with other numbers then it reduces these durations to a single total call time and outputs the number and its total duration. The testData.txt file is used to fun the program and the results.txt gives an example of what the output file should look like.
