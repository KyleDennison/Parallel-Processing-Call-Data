# Parallel-Processing-Call-Data
This was worked on by myself in May 2019 as the final project of a Data Intensive Computing class. The goal of this project was to take CDR call data and to find out how many minutes in total each phone number spent calling others. To do this I used a java implemented version of Hadoop loaded in the IDE IntelliJ to map/reduce the call time data.
